				<h1>COPYRIGHT, AURA, <br>AND CONTROL</h1>
				<p>
					Unlicensed reproduction of media is frequently condemned as unethical, illicit, or even criminal. However, this perspective could overlook the broader economic and ideological structures that shape access to culture and knowledge. Copyright laws, largely driven by corporate interests, create monopolisticsystems that prioritize profit over accessibility, reinforcing systemic inequalities by restricting cultural participation to those with lesser financial means. This thesis examines how digital piracy, and the circulation of unlicenced media challenge these structures of ownership, highlighting the connections of intellectual property law and media accessibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					By researching piracy within broader discussions of authorship, originality, and access, this thesis examines how digital media landscapes<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="1">1</sup>
					both reinforce and resist capitalist control. It critically analyses piracy not simply as an act of theft, but a form of resistance against the dominant economic models and offers alternative approaches of media distribution. Through this lens, this thesis investigates the power dynamics embedded in contemporary intellectual property regimes, ultimately questioning who has the right to own, distribute, and engage with media in the digital age.<br><br><br>

<div class="item3">
	<h2>Introduction</h2>	<div id="introduction"><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<p>Unauthorized reproduction and distribution of media are often viewed as
unethical or even criminal. In 2023, piracy websites saw about 229.4 billion
visits, a 6.7% increase from the previous year (Muso, 2024), showing the scale
of illegal media consumption despite legal efforts to prevent it. The dominant
view treats piracy as a threat to creativity and innovation, supporting strict
intellectual property laws. However, this perspective overlooks a deeper issue
about ownership, access, and control. Current copyright systems favor corporate
interests, limit access to cultural works, and reinforce economic inequality.</p>

<p>The rise of digital piracy challenges these restrictive systems. By
bypassing traditional gatekeepers, piracy questions ideas of authorship,
originality, and legitimacy. This research aims to rethink these ideas and
challenge the conventional view of piracy. Scholars like Lawrence Lessig (2001)
and Kembrew McLeod (2005) have criticized the expansion of intellectual
property laws, focusing on how they enable corporate monopolies. This thesis
builds on their work, showing how piracy can resist corporate control over
cultural production. It also draws on Walter Benjamin (1936) and John Berger
(1972), who examined how reproduction technologies shift art from being an
elite possession to something accessible to the masses, offering new insights
into the cultural value of pirated media.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this thesis questions who has the right to own, share, and
engage with media. It advocates for a system that balances creators’ rights
with public access to culture and knowledge, challenging dominant views on
piracy and calling for intellectual property laws that promote equity,
inclusion, and broader cultural participation.</p>

<h2>Exclusivity</h2><div id="exclusivity"><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<p>Intellectual property (IP) laws are meant to regulate who owns, uses, and
distributes creative works, ensuring that creators can benefit financially from
their ideas. In reality, these laws primarily serve the interests of large
corporations rather than the artists and innovators they claim to protect.</p>

<p>Shaped by capitalist ideologies, IP laws overwhelmingly favour privileged
corporations while systematically excluding underprivileged creators. Instead
of encouraging creativity and innovation, IP laws function as mechanisms for
profit-making, reinforcing economic inequality by restricting access to culture
and knowledge. Far from being a fair system, these laws enable corporate
monopolies to hoard intellectual property, often restricting rather than
encouraging artistic progress.</p>

<p>The scale of this injustice is undeniable. For instance, artists like Kate
Nash have spoken out about how the traditional music industry fails to support
independent musicians, forcing them to seek alternative income streams like
OnlyFans<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="2">2</sup> to fund their tours (Rolling
Stone, 2024). Meanwhile, major record labels and streaming platforms continue
to profit immensely while paying artists fractions of a cent per stream, with
Spotify compensating between $0.003 and $0.005 per play (Ditto, 2025). IP laws
do not just protect creators, they also function as tools for profit-making,
reinforcing economic inequality by restricting access to culture and knowledge.</p><br>

<p>A core principle of IP law is exclusivity; the idea that only the creator,
or the company that owns the rights, can control how a work is used. While this
system is intended to protect creators, it also restricts how people can engage
with cultural works. Fan creations such as remixes, fan fiction, and derivative
art are often removed from online platforms due to copyright claims. Large
corporations aggressively enforce these laws to maintain control over cultural
production, limiting how audiences can interact with and reinterpret creative
works.</p>

<p>This consolidation of control also leads to monopolistic practices, where a
small number of companies dominate entire industries. As Lawrence Lessig argues
in <i>The Future of Ideas (2001)</i>, modern copyright laws have shifted from
protecting creators to serving corporate interests, ultimately restricting
public engagement with culture. Lessig notes, “After two centuries of copyright
statutes, the scope of copyright has exploded, and the reach of copyright is
now universal” (2001, p. 106). Lessig suggests that this change, has resulted
in a world where “any act of ‘copying’ is presumptively regulated by the
statute; any derivative use is within the reach of this regulation” (2001, p.
107). Lessig contrasts this with an earlier time, explaining that between 1790
and 1799, “the vast majority of creative work was free for others to use; and
the work that was protected was protected only for limited purposes” (2001, p.
106). Meaning that while copyright used to protect creative works with loose
restrictions, it has now expanded to regulate nearly all forms of copying and
derivative use, creating universal control over creativity.</p>

<p>In this environment, the freedom to engage with cultural works as audiences
or creators is severely restricted. Lessig’s reflections on the evolution of
copyright law explain how we have shifted from a system where “a tiny part of
creative content was controlled” to one where “most of the most useful and
valuable creative content is controlled for every significant use” (2001,
p.107). </p><br>

<p>Similarly, in<i> Freedom of Expression® (2005)</i> Kembrew McLeod argues
that strict copyright enforcement often suppresses creativity rather than
fostering it. He references Thomas Jefferson’s<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="3">3</sup>
belief that “ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe,”
(2005, p.108) emphasizing that the unrestricted flow of knowledge, information,
and culture is essential to a thriving democracy. While Jefferson recognized
the potential dangers of intellectual property laws in limiting access to
ideas, he did not oppose copyright itself. Instead, he acknowledged its role to
motivate innovation, stating, “Society may give an exclusive right to the
profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may
produce utility” (2005, p.108). Jefferson's recognition of the fine balance
between encouraging innovation and ensuring that knowledge is shared and
accessible is incredibly relevant today.</p><br>

<p>One major effect of intellectual property (IP) law is that it turns creative
works into commercial products. Copyrights, trademarks, and patents allow
creators to control how their work is shared and sold. This encourages
innovation and artistic production, but in practice, it often benefits large
corporations rather than individual artists. Companies like Amazon, Apple, and
Disney use IP laws to dominate entire industries, profiting from music, films,
software, and literature while controlling how they are accessed and
distributed.</p>

<p>In 2020, the House Judiciary Committee found that Amazon “has significant
market power over the entire book industry, including sales, distribution, and
publishing. In the U.S. market, Amazon accounts for over half of all print book
sales and over 80 percent of e-book sales” (Bond et al., 2022, p.213). A
publisher wouldn’t be able to sustain itself if their books are not sold on
Amazon. Even the biggest publishers can't compete with Amazon's control of the
book market. In an article published by <i>The Nation</i> <i>(Vaheesan and
Pincock, 2024),</i> it is stated that Amazon “won’t hesitate to retaliate
against publishers that step out of line”. In 2014, when Amazon and Hachette<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="4">4</sup>
were engaged in a dispute regarding the distribution of publications, Amazon
marginalised the publisher on its website for a period of eight months. “These
retaliatory games include removing the “buy” button beneath a title’s listing
on the site, delaying shipping books to customers, claiming that titles are out
of stock when Amazon is actually just refusing to restock the titles, and
rejecting pre-sales for new books” (Vaheesan and Pincock, 2024). This had a
significant impact on the publisher's sales, with Hachette reporting an “18
percent drop in US sales during the third quarter of 2014” (Vaheesan and
Pincock, 2024). Hachette authors also experienced a decline in income and
perceived influence in the publishing world when Amazon stopped selling their books.</p>

<p>IP laws have become weapons for corporate giants to crush competition and
exploit creators rather than protect them. Amazon’s power on the book industry
proves how these laws serve as tools for monopolization, allowing one company
to dictate who succeeds and who is silenced. Its retaliation against Hachette,
deliberately sabotaging sales and punishing authors, shows the ruthless lengths
they will go to in order to maintain control. Until these rigged systems are
dismantled, corporations like Amazon will continue to profit while artists,
writers, and independent publishers are left fighting for survival.</p><br>

<p>Strict intellectual property laws also create financial barriers to
accessing culture and knowledge. By restricting the use of copyrighted
materials, these laws make it difficult for people with lower socioeconomic
status and institutions to afford essential resources. For example, schools and
libraries must pay high licensing fees to legally distribute textbooks,
academic papers, and other educational materials. </p>

<p>A recent paper <i>The Cost of Knowledge: Academic Journal Pricing and
Research Dissemination (An, Williams and Xiao, 2024) </i>research the economic
barriers caused by high academic journal prices, which disproportionately
affect institutions with fewer resources, stating: “The inability to pay for
subscriptions restricts access to research to privileged individuals and
institutions. This may create an imbalance in the infrastructure required by
research and collaboration opportunities, widening the gap in knowledge
dissemination and knowledge creation across institutions, communities, and
countries” (2024, p. 3). </p>

<p>The research further highlights how market power in the academic publishing
industry leads to restricted access to research, particularly for lower-ranked
institutions and developing countries. Think of all the Academia.edu and MIT
Press peer-reviewed journals and high quality images (e.g. JSTOR) that are
unaccessible to me as I write this thesis. This disproportionately affects
students and researchers in underfunded institutions, who may struggle to
access the materials they need for learning and who cannot access online
libraries via their institution. The very tools meant to bridge gaps or produce
knowledge now further entrench social and economic inequality. This is not just
about access, it’s about opportunity. Wealthier individuals, with privileged access
to culture and knowledge, continue to solidify their standing, while those with
a lower socioeconomic status are left to struggle against rising barriers.</p><br>

<p>Copyright and intellectual property laws have become tools for corporate
monopolization, and cultural gatekeeping. Like Jefferson stated, these laws
were created to protect creators and create profit from their own work as an
encouragement to pursue new ideas, but now have evolved into a system where it
reinforces economic inequality, privileging large corporations while
restricting public access to knowledge, and punishing those who dare to engage
with culture in progressive ways. </p>

<p>To explore these tensions more deeply, we can turn to Walter Benjamin’s
theory of the aura which helps us understand how reproduction challenges
traditional ideas of ownership and value in cultural works in the context of
piracy and intellectual property. Benjamin’s concept helps us understand the
transformation of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, a concept that
resonates strongly with the modern digital landscape. Through piracy and
compression technologies, works are democratized and made more accessible, but
this often comes at the cost of commercial value. In the next chapter, we will
delve into how piracy disrupts traditional systems of value through Benjamin’s
concept of <i>aura</i>.</p><br>


<h2>Reimagined Aura</h2><div id="aura"><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<p>In an era where digital media can be copied and shared instantaneously, the
idea of authenticity and originality becomes increasingly complex. The
corporate control over intellectual property not only restricts access but also
alters how we perceive and interact with media. As traditional ownership models
collapse under digital reproduction, questions of authenticity and originality
become central. Walter Benjamin’s concept of aura provides a another
perspective to analyze this shift, revealing how technological reproduction
redefines the value of art in the digital age. As mechanical and digital
reproduction erode traditional distinctions between originals and copies,
piracy emerges as both a challenge to capitalist modes of ownership and a tool
for democratising access to media. This chapter covers how pirated media is reshaping
our understanding of artistic value, accessibility, and innovation, raising
questions about the future of cultural distribution in an age of endless
replication.</p><br>

<p>Walter Benjamin’s concept of the <i>aura</i>, introduced in his essay <i>The
Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1936), </i>refers to the
unique presence and authenticity of an artwork tied to its specific time and
place, stating “In even the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking:
the here and now of the work of art—its unique existence in a particular place.
It is this unique existence—and nothing else—that bears the mark of the history
to which the work has been subject” (Benjamin, 1936, p.21). According to Benjamin,
traditional works of art, such as paintings or sculptures, possess an
authenticity that is gained from their physical existence and the historical
context in which they are situated. “Whereas the authentic work retains its
full authority in the face of a reproduction made by hand, which it brands a
forgery, this is not the case with technological reproduction” (Benjamin, 1936,
p.21) stating that technological reproduction, unlike handmade reproductions,
which are seen as forgeries, undermines the authority of the authentic work by
creating copies that are not easily dismissed as fraudulent, thus challenging
the uniqueness and aura of the original. </p>

<p>He mentions that there are two reasons for this. The first reason is that it
is easier to make copies of things using technology than by hand. And his
second reason is that technological reproduction can place the copy of the
original in situations which the original itself cannot, Benjamin gives us an
example: “it enables the original to meet the recipient halfway, whether in the
form of a photograph or in that gramophone record. The cathedral leaves its
site to be received in the studio of an art lover; the choral work performed in
an auditorium or in the open air is enjoyed in a private room” (Benjamin, 1936,
p.21). Benjamin’s concern that the aura is “fundamentally threatened by
technological reproduction, which allows artworks to be mechanically copied,
thereby stripping them of their unique presence and making them infinitely
reproducible” (Benjamin, 1936, p.21). </p>

<p>Benjamin argued that the loss of aura, while diminishing the uniqueness of
traditional art, had the potential to democratize art by making it accessible
to the public: “It might be stated as a general formula that the technology of
reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the sphere of tradition. By
replicating the work many times over, it substitutes a mass existence”
(Benjamin, 1936, p.22) and shifts the function of art from ritual to politics,
enabling a more participatory and politically engaged relationship with art.</p><br>

<p>Just as photography and film disrupted traditional notions of artistic
originality in Benjamin's time, modern digital reproduction technologies
(through file-sharing networks, torrents and compression) further blur the
distinction between original and copy. In this sense, pirated media can be seen
as the next stage in the transformation of art, removing the constraints of
ownership and exclusivity. This begs the question: Can digital reproductions,
including pirated media, create new forms of aura or authenticity?</p><br>

<p>Building on Benjamin’s idea that mechanical reproduction changes the way we
perceive and engage with art, John Berger further examines how mass media and
reproduction alter the authority of art and who has access to it. John Berger’s
<i>Ways of Seeing (1972) </i>provides a framework for understanding the
cultural implications of digital piracy. Berger builds on Benjamin’s idea of
the aura, he focuses on how reproduction challenges the power structures of the
art world, making art more accessible and less tied to elitist institutions. </p>

<p>Berger explains that the visual arts have always been viewed as something
unique and distinct. He states, “originally this preserve was magical or
sacred” (Berger, 1972, p.32), meaning that art was once reserved for special,
almost spiritual, contexts. Initially, it was about the physical locations
where art was created, such as palaces or private homes. Over time, art became
more associated with the social elite, entering the culture of the ruling
class. Despite this shift, art remained physically separate and isolated in
those exclusive spaces. As Berger notes, “During all this history the authority
of art was inseparable from the particular authority of the preserve” (Berger,
1972, p.32). In other words, the power of art was tied to the specific, restricted
spaces in which it resided. Furthermore, he adds, “The experience of art, which
at first was the experience of ritual, was set apart from the rest of life -
precisely in order to be able to exercise power over it” (Berger, 1972, p.32).
This suggests that the experience of art was intentionally separated from
everyday life to maintain control over its meaning and influence. Berger argues
that the advent of reproduction technologies challenges this power structure,
as it makes art more accessible to the broader public.</p><br>

<p>This statement ties strongly with debates
about pirated intellectual property. Digital reproductions, even pirated ones,
can create a new kind of <i>aura</i> rooted in accessibility, shared
experience, and cultural relevance. For example, pirated media often circulates
outside of official channels, creating a sense of subcultural authenticity or
resistance to corporate control. This new form of <i>aura</i> is not tied to
the physical object or its institutional context but emerges from the ways in
which the reproduced media is shared, reinterpreted, and integrated into
everyday life. “For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral,
ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free. They surround us in the
same way as a language surrounds us. They have entered the mainstream of life
over which they no longer, in themselves, have power” (Berger, 1972, p.32).</p>

<p>In this sense, the <i>aura</i> or “authenticity” of pirated media lies in
its ability to connect people, challenge power structures, and create new
cultural meanings, even as it undermines the traditional <i>aura</i> or
authority of the original work.</p><br>

<p>While Berger was concerned with how television and photography reshaped the
meaning of art, Hito Steyerl<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="5">5</sup> takes this discussion into today’s digital era, examining how low-resolution, widely circulated images operate within
capitalism. Steyerl gives us valuable insight on how degraded images (often
pirated) are stripped of commercial value yet gain new political and social
significance through their widespread accessibility, reinforcing this new form
of aura or authenticity.</p>

<p>In her essay <i>In Defense of the Poor Image (2009)</i>, she investigates
how compressed, low-resolution and widely distributed digital films and images,
what she calls <i>poor images</i>, function within contemporary capitalism.
“The poor image […] has been expelled from the sheltered paradise that cinema
seems to have once been. After being kicked out of the protected and often
protectionist arena of national culture, discarded from commercial circulation,
these works have become travelers in a digital no-man’s land, constantly
shifting their resolution and format, speed and media, sometimes even losing
names and credits along the way” (Steyerl, 2009). </p>

<p>Her contemporary view on digital image reproduction aligns with digital
piracy on intellectual property as well. As Steyerl notes, poor images are
removed from their original context, no longer confined to the protectionist<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="6">6</sup>
realms of national culture or commercial circulation. Instead, they inhabit a
“digital no-man’s land” where they are constantly transformed, losing
resolution, format, and even identifying details like names and credits.</p>

<p>This process of degradation and redistribution mirrors the dynamics of
digital piracy, where intellectual property is often disregarded in favor of
accessibility and dissemination. Steyerl argues that the <i>poor image</i>, by
shedding its visual and commercial substance, regains political potency and
creates a new aura, “This aura is no longer based on the permanence of the
“original,” but on the transience of the copy” (2009). Steyerl is proposing that
the value of an image may lie less in its exclusivity and more in its ability
to circulate, provoke, and connect.</p>

<p>So, rather than Benjamin’s claim that aura is lost, we might say
it&nbsp;mutates, into something fluid, dynamic, and collective. Pirated media,
instead of being a mere copy, becomes a&nbsp;living artifact, shaped by its
digital journey and community interaction.</p><br>

<p>As we move further into an age of endless
replication and digital circulation, the question of whether digital
reproductions can create new forms of aura or authenticity remains open.
Perhaps the answer lies not in trying to reclaim the aura of the past, but in
reimagining what authenticity means in a world where the line between original
and copy continues to blur. By embracing the transformative potential of
digital reproduction, we may discover new ways to value and engage with art and
media, ones that prioritize accessibility, participation, and innovation over
exclusivity and control.</p>

<p>Benjamin’s concept of the aura, once tied to the
unique, physical presence of art, is increasingly challenged by digital
reproduction, which democratizes access but also undermines traditional
authority. Berger’s analysis of mass media further highlights how reproduction
disrupts the exclusivity of art, making it more accessible to the public and
dissolving power structures tied to elite institutions. Steyerl’s idea of the <i>poor
image</i> further illustrates how low-resolution, widely circulated images,
often stripped of commercial value, gain new political and social significance
in the digital landscape. This shift in perspective also calls for a
reconsideration of the legal and economic structures that govern creative work.
If traditional copyright law was built on the foundation of scarcity and
ownership, how does it function in a digital landscape where replication is
effortless and access is cruicial? The next chapter explores alternatives to
copyright, investigating how open licensing, digital commons, and decentralized
distribution models offer pathways toward a more balanced and sustainable
approach to intellectual property.</p><br>

<h2>Control</h2><div id="control"><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<p>Having examined how digital reproduction and piracy challenges
traditional sytems of ownership and authenticity, the next step is to investigate
the legal frameworks that govern intellectual property. As the digital
landscape shifts, these traditional frameworks become increasingly inadequate,
prompting the need for new, more inclusive systems that prioritize access and
collective participation.</p>

<p>Copyright law has historically functioned as a mechanism of
control, reinforcing economic inequalities and privileging corporate ownership
over creative works. As discussed in previous chapters, the digital age has
fundamentally destabilized traditional notions of ownership and intellectual
property, necessitating a re-evaluation of the systems governing creative
production and distribution. By examining open licensing models, this chapter
considers a few possibilities of a more equitable and sustainable approach to
intellectual property.</p>

<p>One of the open licensing models is the Creative Commons
(CC) license. It offers a flexible alternative to traditional copyright by
allowing creators to retain some rights while enabling public access. Lawrence
Lessig, the co-founder of CC, states the motivations behind his decision to set
up the CC: “At the time, the prevailing view was if you weren’t in the
traditional ‘all rights reserved’ camp, you must be anti-copyright or a pirate.
We sought to establish some middle ground because we recognized that, in fact,
many people believed in copyright but did not believe that their creative works
should be as tightly regulated as they were under the all rights reserved model”
(<i>Interview with Lawrence Lessig</i>, 2011). This quote reflects Lessig’s
vision behind creating Creative Commons, enabling creators to share and build
upon others’ works without restrictive legal barriers, “in which the rules of
exchange are not defined by commerce but depend on the ability to share and
build on the work of others freely” (<i>Interview with Lawrence Lessig</i>,
2011).</p>

<p>One example of a platform that relies heavily on Creative
Commons licensing is Wikipedia. Wikipedia's content is licensed under CC BY-SA
4.0, which allows users to share and adapt the material, provided they give
appropriate credit and share any derivative works under the same license (Creative
Commons, no date). This has enabled Wikipedia to become a global repository of
freely accessible knowledge.</p><br>

<p>Copyleft is another legal framework that builds on
the principles of openness, ensuring derivative works remain open and free for
modification and redistribution. Unlike traditional copyright, which restricts
use, copyleft mandates that all adaptations continue to follow the same
open-access principles. It is most commonly associated with the free software
movement, particularly through licenses like the GNU General Public License (GNU
GPL, or simply GPL), which was created by Richard Stallman in 1989. Under
copyleft licenses such as the GPL, software and other creative works are made
available to the public with the stipulation that anyone who distributes or
alters the work must also make the source code or content available under the
same copyleft terms. This ensures that subsequent users have the same freedoms
to use, modify, and share the work as the original creator intended.</p>

<p>The GPL project was created by Richard Stallman with the goal of providing a
complete UNIX<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="7">7</sup>-compatible software system
that could be freely given to everyone. Stallman explains in <i>The GNU
Manifesto</i>, “I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who
can use it” (Stallman, 1987). He envisioned a system that would ultimately
replace proprietary software and would be freely shared and distributed among
users. The concept of copyleft is fundamental to GPL. Stallman was committed to
ensuring that GPL software remained free. As he puts it, “Everyone will be
permitted to modify and redistribute GPL, but no distributor will be allowed to
restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary modifications
will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain free”
(Stallman, 1987). This ensures that users can freely modify and share the
software without the fear of restrictions or commercialization.</p>

<p>Stallman also rejected proprietary software, stating that “Software sellers
want to divide the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share
with others” (Stallman, 1987). He felt that this conflicted with his values, so
he dedicated himself to creating software that would be free for all. He
further explained, “I consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a
program I must share it with other people who like it” (Stallman, 1987).</p><br>


<p>Both Lawrence Lessig and Richard Stallman have advocated a
shift away from ownership and control. They advocate for systems that
prioritize accessibility, collaboration, and the public good. Their work
demonstrates that it is possible to create legal frameworks that respect
creators’ rights while simultaneously promoting the broader societal benefits
of knowledge sharing and cultural exchange.</p>

<p>While alternative models like Creative Commons and copyleft
question traditional notions of copyright, they still operate within the
broader framework of intellectual property law. Rather than discarding
copyright, these models seek to work within and expand it, offering a more
inclusive approach that balances creators’ rights with the public’s need for
access to culture and knowledge. By critically examining these models, we see
how they can shift the balance, encouraging accessibility and collaboration
while still protecting creators’ rights.</p>

<p>By critically examining open licensing models like Creative
Commons and copyleft, we have seen how alternative frameworks can shift the
balance in the digital landscape. Where traditional models of ownership and
control are increasingly questioned, it is essential that we rethink
intellectual property laws to foster more equitable systems. As digital media
continues to evolve, so too must the legal frameworks that govern it, moving
away from exclusionary practices and toward inclusive systems that reflect the
diverse ways in which we engage with and create cultural and intellectual
works. Only by embracing this paradigm shift can we ensure a more just and
accessible future for media, creativity, and knowledge in the digital age.</p><br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2><div id="conclusion"><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<p>The study's examination of copyright and intellectual
property (IP) laws reveals a system that, while intended to protect creators,
has been exploited by corporate interests to increase economic inequality and
restrict access to culture and knowledge. Instead of encouraging innovation,
these laws frequently serve as tools for monopolistic control, marginalizing
independent artists and underprivileged creators. The struggles of musicians
and the publishing dominance of Amazon exemplify how IP laws often privilege
corporate power over artistic freedom and public access. Furthermore, the
financial barriers imposed by strict copyright enforcement disproportionately
affect lower socioeconomic communities, deepening existing inequalities in
education and cultural participation.</p>

<p>By engaging with Walter Benjamin’s concept of the aura, we
examined how digital reproduction challenges traditional notions of ownership
and authenticity, breaking down exclusivity while reshaping cultural
significance. John Berger’s analysis of mass media and Hito Steyerl’s concept
of the poor image further emphasize how digital circulation democratizes art
but also disrupts established hierarchies. In this context, pirated media
emerges not simply as a legal violation but as a form of resistance, one that
redefines authenticity, prioritizes collective engagement, and challenges
capitalist ownership structures.</p>

<p>Alternative models like Creative Commons and Copyleft offer
a path forward, proving that intellectual property frameworks can be both
inclusive and sustainable. Advocates such as Lawrence Lessig and Richard
Stallman demonstrate that it is possible to balance the rights of creators with
public access to knowledge. These models shift the focus from corporate profit
to collaboration and accessibility, challenging the exclusionary nature of
traditional copyright laws and advocating for a more just and equitable
cultural landscape.</p><br>


<p>Ultimately, this study underscores the urgent need to
rethink intellectual property laws in the digital age. The current system,
dominated by corporate interests, stifles creativity, restricts access, and
exacerbates inequality. To encourage a truly open and innovative cultural
sphere, we must embrace alternative frameworks that prioritise accessibility,
and collaboration. A future where knowledge and creativity are democratised
requires ongoing resistance to restrictive IP laws and a commitment to legal structures
that reflect the evolving ways in which we create, share, and engage with
culture. By challenging the system and advocating for a more inclusive
approach, we can ensure that the benefits of intellectual property serve
society as a whole, not just those with the means to control it.</p><br>
